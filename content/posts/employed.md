I got employed! At the very last minute of my STEM OPT unemployment grace period. Now that I can finally take a breather, I want to share *honestly* what those two months of job searching were like. 

Here's the best way I can describe it: every day felt like wearing a choker that tightened a little more as time went on. I kept telling myself this job hunt wasn't the end of the world, but such effort wasn't enough to ignore how much I wanted to stay in the U.S. It's been almost eight years since I first came here to study. The idea of returning to Korea, my home country, didn't feel like simply "going back". It felt more like starting over in a country only partly familiar, with a different work culture, lifestyle, and ways of communication.

That mix of longing to stay and the pressure of time was suffocating. Resting never felt like rest. I went through many emotions, quite a lot of them heavy. But two things kept me going: God and the people who were there for me. 

In the past, out of pride, I rarely asked my friends or acquaintances for help. Admitting I was unemployed and needed help like referrals felt embarrassing. I wanted to be the one helping, not asking. But with so little time, I pushed myself to reach out. And to my surprise, reconnecting with old friends and cousins was joyful. Sending the first message was hard, but after that it was fun and heartwarming. After a catch-up, some wrote referrals, some introduced me to their networks, and one even tried to bring me onto his startup. All of these gestures went far beyond what I expected. But it didn't end there.

Those conversations became my daily energy boosts that kept me moving forward. Encouraged by advice I received, I gained confidence about myself and reached out even further--to people I hadn't spoken to in years or had met only briefly in my life. I emailed a professor from high school, a friend I met on a flight to Korea, and countless people on LinkedIn.

Not a single one who responded hesitated to help. I was touched. They were the reason I was able to keep applying and networking, even in the hardest weeks. 

When I had just two weeks left, one friend told me firmly: *"It is possible, even if it feels impossible."*  
So I kept going.

When one week remained and I felt guilty for suddenly messaging old friends, one of them thanked me for remembering him and reaching out to him for help.  
So I continued reaching out.

During the last days, when it felt like it was all over, I prayed and told myself to believe in God.
And then I tried once more.

Yes, this job search taught me a lot about how to effectively target opportunities, present myself, and navigate the process with persistence. But more than that, it showed me just how many people are willing to help. Maybe because they have been in my shoes. Maybe simply out of kindness. And I thank all of them. Deeply. For carrying me through one of the hardest times of my life. Thanks to them, I am writing this post from my apartment in the U.S.

Now, I want to give it back. Not just with referrals like I used to, but even further by reaching into my own network--whether that's a friend, a manager, or even a CEO--to help someone else in need. Because I know how hard this is and that everyone, at some point, needs help.

Job searching is hard. No, let me correct myself. It feels impossible these days. And for applicants running out of time or resources, it’s even harder. That’s why even the smallest act of support matters. What feels insignificant to me may be the spark that keeps someone else going. And sometimes, that’s all they really need.
