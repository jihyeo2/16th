Today, I watched a movie called *No Reservations*. It is a film I first saw back in middle school with my dad in Korea. Back then, movies were one of the few ways I could catch a glimpse of what life looked like on the other side of the world--especially in America. Little by little, watching those stories unfold on screen, I began to dream about studying and living in the U.S. And by God's grace, and with the unwavering support of my devoted parents, that dream became my reality.

Looking back now, I realize it's already been eight years since I first came to the States. Just a few days ago, I was driving down streets that looked just like the ones in those old movies, cooking in a kitchen that reminded me of scenes from so many American TV shows. And again, I felt it--I'm living one of my dreams.

And I am deeply thankful for that.

But today--ironically--I'm living in that dream knowing it could be coming to an end soon. I was laid off last Friday due to company downsizing, and because of an EAD card delivery issue I had, I'm now left with just 58 days to find a job and stay. Less than two months. Given how tough the job market has been and how familiar this kind of uncertainty is--just like last year when I was job hunting right after graduation--it's no surprise that worry was the first thing that flooded my mind. And it hasn't left yet.

However, I must remind myself that this isn't the end of the road. No matter how it turns out to be, one thing is true--I got to live my dream. And if I do end up having to leave the U.S., maybe that's part of a greater plan. I didn't come here on my own. God brought me here, and he will lead me wherever I'm meant to go next.

So what now? I give it everything. All in! Try my very best to find a job--full-time or internship--over these next two months. And when the times comes, I'll accept whatever comes. 

With God, I got this.  

Update: umm...it hasn't gone quite the way I promised to myself in this post, but you know, it's getting there hehe.
